<h2><a name="startup" class="heading">Start Up</a></h2>

<p>To run the application in networked client mode, type the following command on the
command line:</p>

&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<code>java -jar runme.jar</code>

<p>When the application starts up in this mode for the first time, you should see the
following dialog:</p>

<div style="text-align: center"><img src="Connect to Server (1).png"><br><br>
<span style="font-style: italic">Figure 1: The Connect to Server dialog</span></div>

<h2><a name="connect" class="heading">How to Connect to a Server</a></h2>

<p>To connect to a server that is online, follow these steps:

<ol>
<li>Type the server location in the Server Location text field. The server location can be
a host name (e.g. <code>java.sun.com</code>) or an IP address (e.g.
<code>192.168.1.100</code>).</li>
<li>Type the port number on the server in the Port text field. The port must be between
<code>0</code>
and <code>65,535</code>, inclusive.</li>
<li>After inputing the server location and port number, the Connect button will be
enabled. Click on this button to connect to the server. If all goes well, you should see
the dialog in Figure 3.</li>
<li>Once connected, the text fields in the dialog will be disabled, the text in the
Connect button will change to <code>Disconnect</code>, and the OK button will be enabled.
Click on the OK button to close the Connect to Server dialog and open the main application
window. (See the <a href="#main">Main Application Window</a> section below.)</li>
</ol>

</span></div>

<h2><a name="disconnect" class="heading">How to Disconnect from a Server</a></h2>

<p>To disconnect from a server and change the server location and/or port number, click
on the Disconnect button. The text in the Disconnect button will revert back to
<code>Connect</code>, and the OK button will be disabled again until the client is
connected to a server.</p>

<p>To quit the application, click on the Cancel button. Note that your changes will not be
automatically saved, so if you run the application in networked client mode again, you
will have to re-enter the server location and port number.</p>

<h2><a name="status" class="heading">Status Icons</a></h2>

<p>The following icons appear at the bottom of the Connect to Server dialog in the status
bar and indicate the status of a connection between a client and a server.</p>

<table style="margin-left: auto; margin-right: auto" cellpadding="5" cellspacing="5">
  <tr>
    <td><img src="../images/offline.png"></td>
    <td>Not connected to server.</td>
    <td>The client is not connected to a server.</td>
  </tr>
  <tr>
    <td><img src="../images/connecting.png"></td>
    <td>Connecting to server.</td>
    <td>The client is trying to establish a connection to a server.</td>
  </tr>
  <tr>
    <td><img src="../images/online.png"></td>
    <td>Connected to server.</td>
    <td>The client is connected to the server at the given server location and port.</td>
  </tr>
</table>

<h2><a name="main" class="heading">Main Application Window</a></h2>

<p>The main application window looks and functions the same as the main application window
when running the application in standalone client mode. The only difference is that the
status message at the bottom of the window in the status bar displays the status of the
server connection as well as the server IP address and port number.</p>

<div style="text-align: center"><a href="Main Window.png" target="_blank">
<img src="Main Window.png" style="width:510px; height:360px"></a><br><br>
<span style="font-style: italic">Figure 5: The main application window when running in
networked client mode</span>
</div>

<p><br>If you close the main application window when running in networked client mode, the
server location and port number will be automatically saved to a file called
<code>suncertify.properties</code>. When the application is started in this mode again,
the Connect to Server dialog will be bypassed and the main application window will be
shown along with a message indicating that the client is connected to the server at the
given IP address and port number, as shown in Figure 6 below.</p>

<div style="text-align: center"><a href="Connected to Server (2).png" target="_blank">
<img src="Connected to Server (2).png" style="width:510px; height:360px"></a><br><br>
<span style="font-style: italic">Figure 6: The main application window and a message
indicating the status of the server connection</span>
</div>

<p><br>If a client loses the connection to the server, which could happen when the server
is shut down, for example, a message will appear and notify you that the server connection
has been lost and thus the application will shut down.</p>

<div style="text-align: center"><a href="Connection Lost.png" target="_blank">
<img src="Connection Lost.png" style="width:510px; height:360px"></a><br><br>
<span style="font-style: italic">Figure 7: A message indicating that the server connection
has been lost and thus the application will shut down</span>
</div>

<p><br>If the server is offline and the application is run in networked client mode using
the server location and port number that were saved to <code>suncertify.properties</code>,
you will see the following message:
</p>

<div style="text-align: center"><img src="Connection Refused.png"><br><br>
<span style="font-style: italic">Figure 8: A message indicating that the server connection
couldn't be established</span>
</div>

<p><br>Please see the <a href="../standalone/standalone.html#window">Navigating the Main
Application Window</a> section to read the description of each component in the main
application window.</p>

<h2><a name="notes" class="heading">Important Notes</a></h2>

<ul>
<li>The client will be disconnected from the server automatically if there is no activity
within 10 minutes after the previous activity (e.g. booking a contractor). If you try to
book, unbook, or search for a contractor after 10 minutes have passed, you will see the
error message shown in Figure 7.
</ul>
